# Bloggenix
A Flutter project.

User can create blog on different topic like Tech,Travel,Food,Politics,etc.User can like&save any blog for later reference.He can delete personal blog and remove saved blog. Some necessary profile settings like profile photo,name,password,contact us,rate app, etc are also implemented. Firebase is used to store data of all type.
